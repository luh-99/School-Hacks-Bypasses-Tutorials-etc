## 🔒 Best Practices for Secure Usage

While I take measures to secure this project, it's important for users to follow general security best practices:

- 📦 **Keep dependencies up-to-date** using tools like [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) or [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/).
- 🛠️ Perform regular **code audits** and use tools to check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- 🔑 Use **secure storage** for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials). Consider using environment variables or services like [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).
- 💻 **Scan your code** with static analysis tools like [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).

**🚨 Security is a shared responsibility!** Stay proactive to keep your environment safe.
