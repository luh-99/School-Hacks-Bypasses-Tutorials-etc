# School Bypasses
1. Everything in this repository is still a **WIP** so be patient as ***I am still developing and finding everything.***
2. Everything I find that is usable & easy for idiots (like me) and compatible with my school MacBook
3. _Please feel free to contact me on GitHub or Discord as I am open to suggestions. **I highly recommend you to do so if you have information** as this can help me and others looking for information on the topic. It also helps me push out new information that can help many other people whether we know it or not.
> My Discord should be linked to my GitHub account. 

I will most likely NOT be testing anything that the info contains in this repository as I am doing this for fun. But in case I do test some I will figure out a way to provide the data I have collected._
