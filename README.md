- Everything in this repository is still a **WIP** so be patient as ***I am still developing and finding everything.***
- Everything I find that is usable, easy to use, and compatible with my school MacBook will be added, **BUT** only if I feel it's worth being added.
- _Please feel free to contact me on GitHub or Discord as I am open to suggestions. **I highly recommend you to do so if you have information** as this can help me and others looking for information on the topic. It also helps me push out new information that can help many other people whether we know it or not._
> My Discord should be linked to my GitHub account. 

## Helpful Information
* I will most likely **NOT** be testing anything that the info contains in this repository as I am doing this for fun. But in case I do test some I will figure out a way to provide the data I have collected.

* For the xploitspeed repo below, ***<DO> </NOT>*** use the ones he has uploaded as I have not tried them myself, which means they could be outdated. Instead, go to the "Issues" tab as there are more up-to-date bypasses.
> You can use everything in his repo if you want to.
