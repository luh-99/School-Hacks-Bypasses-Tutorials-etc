# Welcome ðŸ‘‹, please read what I have said below. 

## DISCLAIMER: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! 


## USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!

- ***I am not responsible for you getting in trouble at school or being suspended, even if you get punished for ANYTHING I will still not be liable as you were warned and you knowingly used the info in the repository after being warned. Once again, USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK***

### INFO 
- Everything in this repository is still a **WIP** so be patient as ***I am still developing and finding everything with limited amounts of time.***

- Everything I find that is usable, easy to use, and compatible with my school MacBook will be added, **BUT** only if I feel it's worth being added.

- _Please feel free to contact me on GitHub or Discord as I am open to suggestions. **I highly recommend you to do so if you have information** as this can help me and others looking for information on the topic. It also helps me push out new information that can help many other people whether we know it or not._
> My Discord should be linked to my GitHub account. 

## Helpful Information 
* I will most likely **NOT** be testing anything that the info contains in this repository as I am doing this for fun. But in case I do test something I like, I will figure out a way to provide the data I have collected.

* For the xploitspeed repo below, ***<DO> </NOT>*** use the ones he has uploaded as I have not tried them myself, which means they could be outdated. Instead, go to the "Issues" tab as there are more up-to-date bypasses.
> You can use everything in his repo if you want to.
